# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 2, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I started the challenge, working on a project that I've started a few weeks ago and stopped development.
The project is a game, where I had finished the main engine, it is missing few core features though. Today I worked on the level feature, need more development to complete the task, however, it is almost complete already.

**Thoughts:** Dont skip the tests!!.


### Day 2: January 3, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Completed the level feature, worked on showing results after game iteractions.

**Thoughts**: Need to finish a simple version of the game until next week to stick to the deadline.


### Day 3: January 3, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I've completed my first version of the game.

**Thoughts** Already working better today.
