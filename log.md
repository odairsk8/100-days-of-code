# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 2, 2018 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: I started the challenge, working on a project that I've started a few weeks ago and stopped development.
The project is a game, where I had finished the main engine, it is missing few core features though. Today I worked on the level feature, need more development to complete the task, however, it is almost complete already.

**Thoughts:** Dont skip the tests!!.


### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
